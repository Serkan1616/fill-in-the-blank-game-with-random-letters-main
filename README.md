# fill-in-the-blank-game-with-random-letters
A game of guessing country names with random letters determined by the computer using a stack and circular queue.

Read the unsorted file “countries.txt” and then create a Stack (S1),and sort alphabetically. Add all letters in a Stack (S2). Read the unsorted file “HighScoreTable.txt” and create two Stacks (S3 and S4).

Generate a random number (x), print this number on the screen, and get xth word of S1.
For example; if the randomly generated number is 3, the country “ALGERIA” is selected from the list.
Store this word in a Queue (Q1).
In addition to Q1, create an empty Queue, named Q2, for the game board.
